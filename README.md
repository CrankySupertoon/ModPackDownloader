# ModPack Downloader
A simple command line downloader for Minecraft Forge Modpacks. Also works with Curse manifest JSONs.
# Usage
Execute via command line with two arguments, the manifest json and the folder where you want your mods downloaded.

Example: java -jar modpackdownloader.jar mods.json mods

This will read the mods.json and download all mods to the mods folder.
